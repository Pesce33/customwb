Welcome to the MCWebmin Project!
You can check out our future website at http://MCWebmin.com/

This software is designed to be installed in
/usr/local/mcwebmin/
and run under the user mcwebmin with a webserver (Tested with lighttpd and apache2) running under mcwebmin and running the the directory /usr/local/mcwebmin/www/

MCWebmin officialy supports Debian and Ubuntu, but it should work on most other linux distributions. It does NOT work on Windows, support for that will maybe be added later.
